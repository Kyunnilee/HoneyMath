First, teachers can open the Honeymath platform and create or select problems

Once the problem is created, teachers can save it as a JSON file.

After downloading the JSON file, students can upload it to the platform and start solving the problems 

Students can save their progress at any time, allowing them to pause and resume as needed. The Honeymath platform ensures that the problem data is randomized for each student based on their student ID, providing unique problems while maintaining consistency upon reloading.

Once students complete their assignments, they can submit the JSON file to the teacher. Teachers collect all student JSON files into a folder and use the provided Python script for grading. The script automatically evaluates the assignments, using comments and exception handling to determine scores, and supports partial credit mechanisms.

Additionally, teachers can generate detailed feedback scripts, allowing students to understand the correctness of each step. Students can load the feedback script on the platform to receive specific error messages and improvement suggestions. Teachers can also provide solution scripts that generate answers for each problem based on the randomized data, ensuring fully automated solutions
