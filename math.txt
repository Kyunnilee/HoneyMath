You may set the seed of each problem. The number are generated based on seed. In other words, same seeds will generate same random number, and thus same exercises.

[Mathematical details]
    1. Generate a random number $r$ from a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$.
    2. you want a matrix with integer eigenvalue, then you realize the formula P^{-1}ΛP, where P is the integer invertibla matrix with determinant 1 and Λ is the diagonal matrix with integer eigenvalues
    3. Use PLU decomposition to generate an integer matrix with integer eigenvalues.

[Perfect problem]
    Generate a problem that has:
    1. An integer solution. or if impossible, a very simple solution (ex. 4 root 2)
    2. A solution that has simple calculations.
    3. A problem that has to be solved using the essential concepts of the chapter.
